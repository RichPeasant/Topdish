***Bugs*** 

In the home page when scrolling on the Horizontal Scrolls (specifically the Offers) it may get stuck and will no longer scroll. - JS 

When running on the app for the first time (Fresh compile - Reset memory), the Nearby will not sort and will be left blank. - JS

It takes a while for the Nearby section in home to sort - JS

Sometimes the Nearby will not sort correctly. - JS

Click on the cell of the dish you want more detail about and it will crash. ReloadData() is the reason or the way I am calling it - GL

***Bugs Found After Merging Profile/Login/Tabs/Dishes***

Going to any restaurant from “nearby” tab or after "view all" doesn’t show any info about restaurant (hours, address, dishes, etc…)

Thread exception when viewing menu of specific restaurant from “nearby” tab or after “view all”

Icons for menu need to be changed or removed (right now share/folder like icons)
